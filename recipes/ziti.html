    <h2>BAKED PASTA</h2>
    <p>
        Baked ziti is a popular casserole with ziti pasta and a Neapolitan-style tomato-based sauce characteristic of Italian-American cuisine. It is a form of pasta al forno. Typically, the pasta is first boiled separately until it is nearly, but not completely done. The almost-cooked pasta is added to a tomato-based sauce
